# Week 3 [11/1/2021 â€“ 11/7/2021]
## Official Meeting:
It seems that Ben is not satisfied with our work in week2 and he is unhappy with the effect of the official meeting last week.
#### Ben's suggestions:
- Prioritization should be extremely clear. Don't concentrate on the branch tasks. Just focus on the main task: implement the code and algorithm.
- Concentrate and listen carefully in the meeting to catch the opinion.
- No vedio evaluation. Online questionnaire is good.
- The interface of this should be simple.

#### Task:
- Implement the simple code.
