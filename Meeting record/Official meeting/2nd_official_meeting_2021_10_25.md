# Week 2 [10/25/2021 – 10/31/2021]
## Official Meeting:
### Project Objective：
- implement diagram with overlapping （Algorithm）.
- think out a design of primitive diagram and overlapping diagram that can be shown to users intuitively.
- design a survey used for evaluate the experience to the users by the design for software.
- design and implement User Interface.
### Project tasks division：
- Code/algorithm Implementation (Yuzhe Ruan, Ke Liu, Junyu Liu)
- Literature Study (Chenyang Cui, Yuqing Wang)
- Interface Design/Implementation(Yuqing Wang)
- Evaluation Survey Design(Chengyang Cui)
### Tasks for this week:
- members division
- **implement a the most primitive overlapping diagram**
- **Literature Study** : Key     1. observe the results made by others and compare that with ours.
                                 2. some new algorithms
- entire project formulation（schedule、tasks）
- preliminary idea of Interface Design/Implementation （prototype can be used）
- preliminary idea of Evaluation Survey Design（prototype can be used）
